    <p>
      In consideration of the benefits received from being a member of Outdoors at UVa, Ltd. and participating in its activities,
      I agree for myself, my personal representatives, heirs, and assigns, as follows:
      <br> I understand that the outdoor activities sponsored by Outdoors at UVa, Ltd. involve risk of serious bodily injury
      and even death. I understand and recognize that there are dangers and risks involved in outdoor activities, which often
      occur at locations that are both distant from and inaccessible to doctors, hospitals, and emergency medical care. The
      activities often take place on rough terrain where there is a lack of shelter from inclement weather, including thunderstorms,
      snow, freezing temperatures, high temperatures, and high humidity, all of which are subject to sudden and unforecasted
      changes.
      <br> Some of the activities, such as canoeing, rafting, rock climbing, wilderness hiking, mountain biking, trail running,
      backpacking, kayaking, caving, skiing, snowboarding, and others are inherently dangerous.
      <br> I understand and recognize the risks described above and that other unidentified risks may exist, when I engage in
      Outdoors at UVa, Ltd. sponsored activities. I assume the risks of injury and death arising from my participation in
      these activities.
      <br> I agree to indemnify and hold harmless Outdoors at UVa, Ltd., its directors, officers, and agents from liability arising
      from my injury or death arising from my participation in Outdoors at UVa, Ltd. activities.
      <br>
      <strong>BY SIGNING BELOW, I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND VOLUNTARILY SIGNED THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT
        AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A LEGAL AND ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENT.</strong>
